# My idea here was to use ddplyr because it can split the data into subsets depending on the identifier I choose, which, 
# in this case, is "uasid". I proceed by providing the dataframe I use ("usc" and "ddplyday"), identifying what I want to
# subset on ("uasid"), stating that I want to add a variable to the new dataframe ("mutate"), and finish by creating the 
# new variable. 

# "postday" is the minimum "polldayno" that is greater than or equal to day 117, which is when the Comey letter dropped, and 
# represents the first post-treatment observation for each respondent. 
# "preday" is the maximum "polldayno" that is less than 117, and represents the last pre-treatment observation for each respondent. 

# It is probably not ideal to create subsequent datasets in two steps like I have, but I couldn't find how to add two variables 
# in the same line of code without producing "NULL". I will work on sorting this out so as to reduce user-error. I also end up
# creating a totally new separate dataframe, so I should really try to improve the code because of these two possible issues. 

# By using greaterthan or equal to I am implicitly defining treatment as occuring on day 117, which might induce assumptions
# that are not totally valid, but this can be sorted out with robustness checks if we assume that people didn't actually 
# become aware of the letter until after this date, in which, day 117 wouldn't really be a treatment. 

warnings()

# You'll note that there are some warnings when I use min/max, but I don't think it affects the computation.
# Perhaps I am wrong, but from what I have read it is a bug in the min/max function. I do get "Inf" appearing
# in some places when I print the variable though, so perhaps it isn't totally benign and I am sacrificing the 
# integrity of the data. 

# Below I check that "postday" and "preday" match the first post-treatment observation and the last pre-treatment observation. 
# This is just an eyeball approach at this point, and I don't have anymore time today to check.

# Below I make a variable for the difference in probability in voting for either candidate. This is to 
# create a variable that can show changes in probability for voting for either candidate as a function
# of each candidate. Trump is subtracted from Clinton, so a negative number indicates a higher probability
# of voting for Trump, and a positive number indicates higher probability of voting for Clinton. It 
# consolidates vote probabilities for each candidate, but has the drawback of not showing whether a 
# change occurred because of Trump or Clinton. I make this variable because it could be that the letter 
# does not chagne the probability of voting for one candidate, but does for the other, and creating a dynamic
# variable that responds to movement for either candidate allows us to see whether there is relative movement
# in either direction. 

# In effect, I create a value for each observational period for each observation showing the difference in probability
# of voting for either candidate, where if P(Clinton) > P(Trump) the value is positive, and if P(Clinton) < P(Trump),
# the value is negative. By measuring whether this variable increases or decreases, we can examine whether the 
# probabulity of voting for one candidate increased (decreased) relative to the other candidate.

# Immediate pre and post treatment effect #

# So the above doesn't seem to work as it returns a bunch of NAs for both new variables. 
# What I want to do is just locate last-pre and first-post observations, use those
# observations to locate clint_vote values on those days, and take difference for clint_
# vote for these days to find treatment effect. But,  I can't don't really know how to do
# this, and I DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE CREATING DATAFRAMES, I jsut want to do the damn 
# calculation and then do this for all observational periods.

# Results: Null effect on clint_vote; positive and statistically significant effect on trump_vote; 
# negative and statistically significant result on votediff. This indicates that the letter did not
# have an effect on probability of voting for clinton, but that it did increase an individual's 
# probability of voting for Trump. The statistically significant negative effect on votediff suggests
# that, after the letter, respondents were less likely to vote for Clinton relative to Trump and that 
# the probability of voting for Clinton decreased because voters became more likely to vote for Trump.
# Hence, the letter, as measured here, may not have decreased support for Clinton, but increased support
# for Trump, leading to a net negative effect for Clinton. The null effect on clint_vote and 
# statistically significant postive effect on trump_vote suggests that the net negative effect
# for Clinton was due to an increase in support for Trump rather than a decrease in support for Clinton. 
# Hmm, should ruminate more. So it seems to be a relative increase in support for Trump rather than
# an absoulte decrease in support for Clinton. So they became less likely to vote for CLinton relative
# to Trump, as indicated by the negative coefficient value for votediff. 

# I don't think I need to specify time  because our treatment indicator (postperiod)
# has an explicit time dimension, and essentially represents time. If the treatment wasn't an explicit
# time function, I would need to index by (create a fixed effect) for time because each unit in the panel
# would be observed at multiple points, and you'd need to index each unit of time for each unit, but 
# because the time dimension in our model is soaked up by whether an observation occurs before or after
# treatment, and is modeled by "postperiod" we don't need to create an index (fixed effect) that operates
# as a function for time because our model doesn't actually look at units through time, it only looks 
# at how a treatment (which is time, essentially) affect support, and this effectively "acts" as a time 
# fixed effect. Phew... I think I am describing that correctly, even though it is circumlocuitous. 
# Basically, the nature of our treatment means that we dont really care when an observation takes place
# but whether it is treated or not, and because the treatment clears up reverse causality, it doesn't really
# matter where an observation is indexed because its "time" is soaked up by treatment status. Bad thing
# is that we can't look at delay effects, but that is for later. 

# Here I do it differently to see if findings are an artifact of my code. You'd really only do this if you 
# had a dataset where the data did not have indices for each unit at each time period of observation. 
# For instance, if each US state was observed 37 times, but there was no index for each state representing
# each observational time period 1, 2, 3, ... ,37 for each state, where each state has an index of [1,37]
# representing each observational time period.

# Appears to be no difference.

# Test to see if this works.
